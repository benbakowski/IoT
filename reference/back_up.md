## How frequently is data backed up and where is it stored?

Data is stored off-site from the main {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} service, providing geographical redundancy and enabling services to be restored in the event of a significant incident. Clients will be contacted if data restoration is ever required. All data is encrypted and complies with local data protection requirements.

The following off-site locations are currently used for data backup:

Location                   | Backup location                      
------------- | -------------
IBM Cloud US South (Dallas)| Washington
IBM Cloud United Kingdom (London) | Frankfurt
IBM Cloud Germany (Frankfurt) | London
IBM Cloud Dedicated | As per customer request when ordering {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} Dedicated

**Note:** Future locations might change to reflect data privacy laws, for example the potential impact of Brexit on EU data sovereignty rules.
